# Start Here.

TKTKTK We're in the process of formalizing the creation of a design system. As
such, we need a centralized place where documentation and code (i.e. ui
components) can live to be shared by our digital product platforms. I propose
that Palette become the repository that we adopt for this purpose.

This would mean that any component that's deemed to be an official part of the
design system would need to be migrated to Palette. Furthermore, I propose that
Palette become the official name of Artsy's design system.
